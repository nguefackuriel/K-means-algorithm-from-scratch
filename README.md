# K-means-algorithm-from-scratch

In this project, we will implement K-means algorithm by following all the different required for the implementation:

1. Find the optimal value of K using the Elbow method and the Silhouette analysis.
2. Initialization of the centroids
3. Assign all the data points to their closest cluster
4. Compute the mean in each cluster to have the new centroids
5. Repeat step 3
6. Check the stopping criteria, if true, end the algorithm, if not continue.

We did the implementation using the K-means library from Sklearn and also from scratch, and we got the same results.
